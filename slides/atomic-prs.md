###  Atomic PRs

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> PRs should be as small + focused as possible
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Smaller PRs = shorter feedback loop

Note:

* PRs should be as small as (reasonably) possible
    - Big difference in cognitive load between ten small PRs with a few changes each v. one giant PR
* Smaller PRs = faster reviews
    - Easier to grab between tasks
    - More likely to get done in a reasonable amount of time
