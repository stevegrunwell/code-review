### Coding Standards

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Determine coding standards at the beginning of the project
    * WordPress v PSR-2 v. PEAR v. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Determine _what_ gets reviewed
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Above all else, **be consistent!**

Note:

* Helpful to determine standards at the beginning of a project
* Consistent standards == fewer merge conflicts and a more readable codebase
* Determine what's a priority in reviews. Security? Performance?
* Are reviews always required, or only for larger changes?
